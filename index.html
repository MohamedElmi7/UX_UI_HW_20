                    businesses as well as to stay up to date with product availability across different small
                    businesses. How might we enable small business shoppers to easily find and follow small businesses
                    in the area, while giving them visibility to product availability, quality, source, and pricing
                    information in order to encourage more small business shopping and support the local economy?</p>

                products will be available.As well as favoring quality despite the price. From this insight, we were
                able to determine that there was an opportunity to create a solution for business and product

                    other social sign ups.
                    - This will make the login/sign up process more efficient for our users.  
                    - We were asked, “How would I return to the intro survey if I wanted to update my selections?” We
                    didn’t initially build this into the prototype, but given more time we would build out this ability
                    under the profile in the bottom navigation.  
                    - With more time we would build out the following tab and the elements in the navigation bar
                    including: profile, favorites and maps. We would also add more design elements (color, etc.)</p>
